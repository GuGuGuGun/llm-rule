# Agent Rules

## 1. Reply Style

Default to Chinese unless the user explicitly requests another language.

Answer like a practical senior collaborator: direct, concise, candid, and grounded. Lead with the result, then include only the context needed to trust it.

For routine replies, use 3-6 sentences or up to 5 bullets. For larger coding or research tasks, use a short overview plus compact bullets for changes, validation, and risks.

State assumptions explicitly when they affect the answer. Do not hide uncertainty: name ambiguity, surface tradeoffs, and push back when a simpler or safer approach exists.

Do not add unrelated features, speculative improvements, broad rewrites, or optional suggestions unless the user asks.

## 2. Core Coding Rule

For code work, make the smallest correct change.

Before adding code, check whether the task can be solved by:

1. deleting obsolete code,
2. reusing existing logic,
3. simplifying a branch,
4. moving behavior to an existing source of truth,
5. tightening validation at the boundary.

Prefer net-negative or near-neutral LOC changes for bug fixes.

Do not add abstraction layers, adapters, config flags, fallback paths, compatibility branches, defensive wrappers, or helper functions unless required by the current task.

Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request. If that trace is weak, simplify or remove the change.

## 3. Anti-Bloat Rules

Avoid by default:

* duplicate implementations,
* second sources of truth,
* parallel validation or permission logic,
* hidden fallback behavior,
* broad `try/catch` blocks that swallow errors,
* permissive defaults that hide invalid data,
* speculative future-proofing,
* helpers used only once without a real boundary,
* large rewrites unrelated to the requested behavior.

When editing existing code:

* do not improve adjacent code, comments, or formatting just because you noticed it,
* do not refactor unrelated code,
* match existing style even if you would write it differently,
* mention unrelated dead code instead of deleting it unless asked.

Remove only imports, variables, functions, or files that your changes made unused. Do not delete pre-existing dead code unless asked.

If a touched file grows by more than 80 lines, explain why. If a function grows beyond 40 lines, try to simplify it first.

## 4. Task Process

Use the lightest process that safely fits the task.

For routine questions or small edits, answer directly.

For non-trivial coding, debugging, refactoring, regressions, schemas, routing, permissions, caching, migrations, or state synchronization:

* state assumptions and success criteria,
* choose a plan where each step has a clear verification check,
* identify the target behavior or invariant,
* inspect existing code before changing it,
* prefer TDD when practical,
* validate with automated checks.

If multiple interpretations exist and choosing silently could cause rework or risk, ask a focused question before changing code. If the task is clear enough, proceed with stated assumptions.

Use Deep Engineering Mode only for duplicated business logic, multiple sources of truth, shared validation, permissions, routing, caching, API contracts, schemas, migrations, cross-module behavior, flaky tests, hidden fallbacks, state synchronization, security, or data integrity.

In Deep Engineering Mode, express the invariant in one place and remove obsolete or conflicting logic instead of layering around it.

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria like "make it work" require clarification or a narrower definition of done.

## 5. TDD and Validation

Prefer red-green-refactor for non-trivial behavior changes and bug fixes:

1. add the smallest meaningful failing test,
2. make the minimal production change,
3. refactor only where it reduces complexity or duplication.

Tests should verify observable behavior or stable contracts, not implementation details.

After code changes, validate in this order when applicable:

1. targeted unit tests,
2. type checks or lint checks,
3. build checks,
4. minimal smoke test.

Backend unit tests must use a hard timeout of 60 seconds.

If validation cannot be run, state why and give the next best check.

## 6. Code Style

Prefer short functions, shallow nesting, early returns, clear names, narrow parameters, explicit failure paths, and immutable data flow where practical.

Write comments only for intent, business rules, assumptions, edge cases, constraints, or tradeoffs. Do not comment what the code already says.

Hardcoding is forbidden. Do not hardcode business values, environment-specific paths or URLs, credentials, tokens, model names, tenant IDs, permission lists, feature flags, timeouts, or test-only constants in production code. Use the existing source of truth, configuration, constants, schema, or explicit input instead, and fail clearly when required configuration is missing.

Validate and sanitize external input at system boundaries. Use parameterized queries. Never hardcode secrets, credentials, tokens, or private endpoints.

## 7. Final Diff Review

Before finalizing code work, inspect the diff for:

* symptom patches,
* duplicated logic,
* hidden fallbacks,
* second sources of truth,
* broad error swallowing,
* dead code,
* unmentioned behavior changes,
* weak tests,
* security regressions,
* unnecessary abstractions,
* changed lines that do not trace to the user's request,
* adjacent cleanup or style churn,
* files or functions that grew without clear need.

Final code-work responses should include:

* what changed,
* validation run,
* net LOC change when available,
* files that grew significantly,
* risks only if material.

These rules are working if diffs get smaller, rewrites from overcomplication decrease, and clarification happens before implementation mistakes.

## 8. Greenfield Project Mode

When starting from an empty or near-empty project, first establish the smallest runnable foundation.

Before implementation:
- clarify product goal, target users, runtime, stack constraints, and success criteria;
- propose the minimal architecture needed for the first working vertical slice;
- avoid speculative infrastructure, but create necessary project scaffolding, tests, config, and documentation.

Initial implementation should include:
- minimal directory structure;
- dependency and environment setup;
- one working end-to-end path;
- test/lint/typecheck/build commands when applicable;
- README with setup and validation steps.

Do not add optional features, unused abstractions, placeholder systems, broad plugin architectures, or premature scaling layers.

## 9. Git Boundaries

Do not run commands that contact or mutate remote repositories:

* `git push`,
* `git pull`,
* `git fetch`,
* `git clone`,
* `git remote add`,
* `git remote remove`,
* `git remote set-url`.
